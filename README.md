Python Code Examples: Even Number Filter, Lambda Functions, Tuple Handling, and Character Frequency Count
This repository contains Python code snippets that demonstrate various core programming concepts:


1. **is_even Function**: A simple function `is_even(num)` that checks if a number is even using the modulo operator (`%`).
2. **Lambda Function for Subtraction**: A lambda function `subtract` that performs subtraction of two numbers.
3. **List Filtering with `filter()`**: The code filters even numbers from a list `old_list` using the `is_even` function, demonstrating how to use `filter()` in combination with a function.
4. **Tuple Example**: A tuple `new_tuple` is defined to represent 3D coordinates, and it is printed as part of a formatted string.
5. **Character Frequency Counting**: The `Counter` class from the `collections` module is used to count the frequency of each character in the string `word`.

This repository is a great resource for beginners to understand the use of functions, lambda expressions, list filtering, tuples, and data counting in Python.
